                <p>In 2024, I fell into the darkness.<br>
                Six times I tried to leave this world behind —<br>
                six times the world refused to let me go.</p>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>Then, on December 27th, when the nights were cold and empty,<br>
                a miracle I never dared dream of found me.<br>
                <span class="highlight">Her name was Nafisha.</span><br>
                She had eyes that could silence storms,<br>
                hair that fell like soft rivers down her shoulders,<br>
                and a face so beautiful it defied all words,<br>
                as if even the stars were ashamed to shine beside her.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>For a moment, I believed in something again.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>School began — and with it, the weight of life returned.<br>
                We argued, our voices louder than our hearts,<br>
                but my love never wavered, even when the days grew heavy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>On Valentine’s Day, 2025,<br>
                I gave her a bouquet of flowers —<br>
                every petal carrying the hopes of a boy who had nothing left but her.<br>
                For a while, the sun came back to me.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>But soon, storms rose again between us —<br>
                arguments, misunderstandings, unspoken words tearing at the thread that held us together.<br>
                We broke apart,<br>
                then ran back into each other’s arms, desperate, afraid to lose what we knew was rare.<br>
                But sometimes love isn’t enough to kill the demons we carry.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>A misunderstanding —<br>
                just one —<br>
                ripped the fragile thing we built into pieces.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>We were once so close — closer than words could ever describe —<br>
                and now, we are strangers.<br>
                Strangers who once knew every secret, every dream, every scar on each other's hearts.<br>
                And yet, even now, I still text her to ask how her day was,<br>
                even knowing she may never answer.<br>
                I still pray for her happiness in the quiet moments no one sees.<br>
                I still whisper her name into the silence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>It tears me apart knowing she will never be mine.<br>
                I have to watch her from afar,<br>
                seeing every beauty in nature, every song that plays, and it reminds me of her.<br>
                And no matter how many times I try to move on,<br>
                I always find pieces of her in someone else.<br>
                No one will ever compare.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>They say it’s God’s plan,<br>
                but what if my only plan was her?<br>
                What if I only want her for the rest of my life?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>I pray to God every day,<br>
                that in some other universe, she will be mine.<br>
                That somehow, someway,<br>
                the love we lost will find its way back to us.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>I would give her my life —<br>
                gladly, without a second thought —<br>
                just to spend a few more stolen minutes with Nafisha,<br>
                to see her smile once more before fading into nothing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-section">
                <p>And so, once again, I am left with nothing<br>
                but memories of her laugh,<br>
                the way her hair framed her perfect face,<br>
                and the ache of what could have been.<br>
                And if life was repeated a thousand times<br>
                I would still choose her</p>
